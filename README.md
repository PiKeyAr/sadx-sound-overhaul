Sound Overhaul is a mod for Sonic Adventure DX PC (2004) that fixes sound bugs and improves sound effect quality by replacing all sounds with their counterparts from the Dreamcast version of Sonic Adventure. 

To install Sound Overhaul you can use SADX Mod Installer that sets up SADX Mod Loader and downloads the latest versions of mods automatically. The installer can also convert the Steam version of SADX to the 2004 version, which supports the Mod Loader.
